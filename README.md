<p>Small (2.5kB gzipped), dependency-free library for creating 3D image effect on your website ( just like on Facebook! ).</p>

* reacts to mouse move / mobile device movement! ü§≥ (in iOS Safari ["motion & orientation access"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=30&v=ulsqCFMCajY) has to be enabled)
* based on WebGL shaders
* uses IntersectionObserver to animate only the images that are currently in the viewport

## How to use 
First, you need 2 images: original image, and [depth image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeU5mUASnVI):

Then, prepare image slot with `data-src` and `data-depth-src` attributes containing paths to those images:

```html
<div id="car" data-src="path to original image" data-depth-src="path to depth image"></div>
```

Finally, add `3D-image` library and run it like so:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/3d-image"></script>
<script>
    var car = document.getElementById("car");
    image3D.process(car);
</script>

```
### That's it! ü•§


**Disclaimer:** this library is a work-in-progress, so the API will likely change. There will be more options added like:
* increasing and decreasing 3D effect strength
* reacting to scroll events for devices not supporting DeviceOrientation API
